Usage notes:

1. Rename "MiMe.py" to "MiMe" and move it to a scripts/ folder in your home directory
(or another location useful to you)
MiMe.py -> scripts/MiMe

2. Create a Python 3 environment that includes the following packages:
(e.g., using conda)
-numpy
-subprocess
-argparse
-shutil
-cclib

3. Activate the Python environment

4. While in the activated Python environemt, create the desired .gjf file and submit it to Gaussian:
e.g.  
# external="~/scripts/MiMe -H 'am1' -EF 'wb97xd def2svp' -c 12 -m 48GB" opt=(calcall,ts,noeigen,maxcycles=50,maxstep=10,nomicro,cartesian)
where "~" is your home directory
####
In the above example, this script will optimise to a transition state using wB97XD/def2-SVP for Energy (E) and Forces (F) (specified with -EF) and using Force Constants (Hessian; H) from AM1 (specified with -H). The "nomicro" keyword must always be used when using the external keyword and MiMe.
####

5. If not in a Python environment that contains the required packages, the MiMe script will fail
