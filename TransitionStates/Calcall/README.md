Directory for "calcall" transition state geometry optimizations.  
At each step of the optimization cycle (Berny algorithm) a new Hessian is calculated.  
Using the MiMe script, one level of theory is used for energy and force calculations (E,F) and another for Hessians (H).  
In each directory, TS optimization was performed using wB97xD/def2-SVP Energy and Forces, and various Hessians.
