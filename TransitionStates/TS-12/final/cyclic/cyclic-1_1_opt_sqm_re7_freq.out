 WE'RE IN THE POSITION OF A VISITOR FROM ANOTHER
 DIMENSION WHO COMES TO EARTH AND SEES A CHESS MATCH.
 ASSUMING HE KNOWS IT'S A GAME, HE'S GOT TWO PROBLEMS:

 NINETY PERCENT OF SCIENCE (INCLUDING VIRTUALLY ALL OF CHEMISRY)
 IS IN THAT SECOND CATEGORY.  THEY'RE TRYING TO APPLY
 THE LAWS THAT ARE ALREADY KNOWN.
