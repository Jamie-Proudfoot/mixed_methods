Directory for optimizing 12 transition state geometries using DFT energy and forces with different Hessians:  
opt_sqm = Semi-empirical quantum mechanics (AM1) Hessian  
hf = Hartree-Fock (HF/def2-SVP) Hessian  
dft = Density-functional-theory (wB97XD/def2-SVP) Hessian  
(n.b. in all cases, energy (E) and forces (F) were calculated with DFT: wB97XD/def2-SVP)
