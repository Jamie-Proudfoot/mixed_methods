 WE HAVE SEEN THAT MAN ON THE AVERAGE DOES NOT LIVE ABOVE
 TWO-AND-TWENTY YEARS.  DURING THESE TWO AND TWENTY
 YEARS HE IS LIABLE TO TWO AND TWENTY THOUSAND EVILS,
 MANY OF WHICH ARE INCURABLE.  YET EVEN IN THIS DREADFUL STATE
 MEN STILL STRUT AND POSE ON THE STAGE OF LIFE.
 THEY MAKE LOVE AT THE RISK OF DESTRUCTION,
 INTRIGUE, CARRY ON WAR, AND FORM PROJECTS, JUST AS IF THEY
 WERE TO LIVE IN LUXURY AND HAPPINESS FOR A THOUSAND
 AGES.
