20 organocatalyst structures optimized to their ground-state geometries at various levels of theory  
  
opt = optimization with 1 Hessian calculated at the start (opt=calcfc)  
opt_freq = optimization with 1 Hessian calculated every 60 steps (each reopt), obtained from a frequency calculation checkpoint file  
opt_hess = optimization with 1 Hessian calculated every 60 steps (each reopt), obtained from a 0 step opt=calcfc checkpoint file
